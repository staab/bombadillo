> Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.

Bombadillo is a simple invented language inspired by the [songs](https://allpoetry.com/Tom-Bombadil's-Song) and speech of Tom Bombadil, from The Lord of the Rings. "Bombadillo" means song, and should be spoken in a musical, full, [woody](http://montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Series_4/23.htm) way, with a bias toward Anapestic emphasis (u u /, e.g., "understand").

# Sample

```
O inderry bower ber nun ringdarry
Rindar bombadillo bel
Delloden ar nevenden
```

Translation:

```
In my treehouse, under the sky
Wind, beckon me
To sleep and dream
```

# Grammar

Bombadillo's grammar works on a Latin-like ending system. There is only one declension, and one conjugation. There are no gerunds, only infinitives, tense is always present, and 1st and 3rd person are conflated (as Tom Bombadil often refers to himself in third person). Voice is a hybrid of declarative and imperative; speaking the language should be considered an act of sub-creation, of calling into being the subject of your song.

```
Declension                            Conjugation

             S.   P.                                 S.     P.
           +-----+-------+                           +------+--------+
Nominative | -a  | -ar   |            1st/3rd Person | -bim | -billo |
Genitive   | -er | -erry |                2nd Person | -dim | -dillo |
Dative     | -o  | -or   |                           +------+--------+
Accusative | -el | -ello |
Ablative   | -ar | -arry |                Infinitive   -den
           +-----+-------+
```

So, for example, using the words for "sing, trees!", bomba- and ind-, you'd use the nominative plural noun ending, and the second person plural verb ending, ending up with "bombadillo, indar!".

Subordinate clauses, whether object, object of the preposition, or adverbial clauses always use the infinitive, and sort of daisy chain case, so an object can be the subject in a dependent clause and retain its accusative ending, and the object of the subordinate clause would also be accusative. For example, "The tree [nom] grows [3rd person singular] leaves [acc], which house [infinitive] caterpillars [acc]".

# Vocabulary

Bombadillo's vocabulary lacks some precision, as it's a language meant for delight, and seeing good things anew, rather than for understanding, naming, or knowing (as Tom Bombadil, The Master, doubtless does as well). Names don't exist in Bombadillo; instead, specific people or things can be referred to using something like kennings. Old Man Willow might be "thick-barked fog-weaver", or "sun brendar vinello twinden". An old-growth pine could be "tall needle-holder", or "fan pinello groden". A squirrel might be a "dubb sinda bomden", or "talkative fat fellow".
