The following is the outline for a short book I hope to write, that interleaves lore of middle-earth with poetry, structured around a grammar for Bombadillo.

# History

We don't know anything about the people who spoke Bombadillo, but given that Tom's name comes from the language, we can assume that he and it are related. There are no written artifacts of the language, for the language itself has no alphabet, it is only found in the world in spoken form.

However, it's existence is not local - hints of it can be found throughout nature, and in whatever civilizations have a deep affinity for the things of comfort, song, and nature. [insert commentary on onomotopoeic aspects, speculation about some hobbit words and their relation to words in Bombadillo. Similarly, consider connections with Elvish].

Of the few who have studied the language, most agree that Bombadillo's origins lie in the creation songs of the Eldar themselves. Hence the convention of speaking almost exclusively in second person; a poem written in Bombadillo should be considered an act of sub-creation, of investing meaning into this world using its own vibrations as the medium. [insert quotes and analysis of the beginning of the Silmarillion to support this. Tell anecdotes of odd things that have happened when Bombadillo is spoken. Cite Tolkien's poem about Bombadil as evidence].


# Notes

Infinitives seem to be a grammatical rather than linguistic construct; remove it in favor of moods, like subjunctive. Gerunds, however, can be used as a formula for converting verbs to nouns.

Make sure to answer who the other known but not named speaker is, mentioned in the intro.

# Introduction

What follows is a short treatise on a discovered language which, for lack of a more accurate name, I have dubbed "Bombadillo", after Tom Bombadil who is the only named (though not known) speaker of the language.

Though much (or all) within these pages is based purely upon supposition and guesswork, Bombadillo remains a linguistic medium well worth studying for its inherent beauty and refreshing view of the world.

As recorded in the Lord of the Rings,

> Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.

Bombadillo is an excellent language for expressing one's "wonder and delight". However, its scope of applicability is extremely narrow; there are very few known words, and although the meaning of a given word may be highly contextual, the topics covered are severely limited.

Of particular interest to the speakers of Bombadillo are the workings of nature, the comforts of home, and other peaceful pursuits. Bombadillo shuns the harness of scientific accuracy; it knows nothing of the works of men's hands, of numbers, tools, or reason; and it abhors perversion, evil, and darkness.

Many words and selections of Bombadillo poetry are included in this book, along with translations into the Common tongue, where relevant. The reader is encouraged to skim through Appendix A of this book before continuing, which gives a short primer on Bombadillo's grammar.

Likewise, Appendix B includes a reference of known vocabulary, along with any relevant notes for particular words.

# Appendix A

- The prevailing [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) is Jussive
  - There is no "realis" mood, that is, the indicative. If an indicative sense is desired, Jussive or Subjunctive may be used instead depending on the function of the verb.
- Person
- Number
- Pronouns
- Genders - each has its own declension
  - Masculine is earthy/woody like Bombadil
  - Feminine is rainy like Goldberry
  - Instead, re-read the creation account and find a theme; maybe divine/earthy; immortal/mortal?
- Nouns
- Adjectives
- Adverbs
- Gerunds - how to noun-ify a verb
- Subjunctive mood and dependent clauses. Nouns retain the case required by the independent clause.
- Prepositions
- Conjunctions
- Interrogative mood
